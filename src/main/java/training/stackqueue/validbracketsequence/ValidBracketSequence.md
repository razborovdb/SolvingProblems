## Description
Given a string sequence consisting of the characters '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', and '}'. Your task is to determine whether or not the sequence is a valid bracket sequence.

The Valid bracket sequence is defined in the following way:

An empty bracket sequence is a valid bracket sequence.
If S is a valid bracket sequence then (S), [S] and {S} are also valid.
If A and B are valid bracket sequences then AB is also valid.
