## Description
A number is considered to be a jumping number if all the adjacent digits in it differ by 1 by absolute difference. 
The difference between 9 and 0 is not considered to be 1. All single digit numbers are considered to be jumping numbers.

Given an integer x, return all the jumping numbers not greater than x, generated 
in increasing order of their most significant digits. See the example for a good visualization of this.
