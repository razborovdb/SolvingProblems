## Description
Compute the factorial of a number. You must use recursion to solve this, do not hardcode answers.

The factorial of a non-negative integer n is defined as the product of all the integers from 1 up through n.

Factorial is indicated with an exclamation point. For example, "5!" is read "Five-factorial".

And the value of 5! is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 which is 120.

0! is defined to be 1.

For a recursive solution, you need to think of the recursive definition. "Factorial is defined as something with this number and factorial of the rest of the numbers
