## Description
Write an in-place Insertion Sort.

Do NOT use a built-in sort routine.

The result should be in ascending order.

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm

The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked 
and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

Time Complexity O(n*2)
