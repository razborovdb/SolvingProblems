## Description
Write an in-place Bubble Sort.
Bubble sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that checks and swaps elements if they are not in the 
intended order. It compares two adjacent elements to find which one is greater or lesser and switches 
them based on the given condition until the final place of the element is found.
