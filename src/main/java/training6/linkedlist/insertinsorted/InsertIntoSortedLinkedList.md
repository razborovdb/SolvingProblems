## Description
Note: Your solution should have O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in l, since this is what you will be asked to accomplish in an interview.

You have a singly linked list l, which is sorted in strictly increasing order, and an integer value. Add value to the list l, preserving its original sorting.

Note: in examples below and tests preview linked lists are presented as arrays just for simplicity of visualization: in real data you will be given a head node l of the linked list
