## Description
Given the head of a linked list and an index to delete at, return the head of the modified list.

If the index is out of range (less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of the list), return null.

The index is zero-based.

Your solution should be O(n). And you should be able to do it with a single pass through the list.
