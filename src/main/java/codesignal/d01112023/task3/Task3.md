Minesweeper is a popular single-player computer game. The goal is to locate mines within a rectangular grid of cells. At the start of the game, all of the cells are concealed. On each turn, the player clicks on a blank cell to reveal its contents, leading to the following result:

If there's a mine on this cell, the player loses and the game is over;
Otherwise, a number appears on the cell, representing how many mines there are within the 8 neighbouring cells (up, down, left, right, and the 4 diagonal directions);
If the revealed number is 0, each of the 8 neighbouring cells are automatically revealed in the same way.

For
field = [[true, false, true, true, false],
[true, false, false, false, false],
[false, false, false, false, false],
[true, false, false, false, false]]
x = 3, and y = 2, the output should be

solution(field, x, y) = [[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1],
[-1, 3, 2, 2, 1],
[-1, 2, 0, 0, 0],
[-1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]
